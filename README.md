#### Highlights + development process
▸I Chose Vue.js as a framework of choice for its simplicity and its ability to use components to make the development process much cleaner.

▸I installed npm packages needed for the project: JSON server, font awesome, bootstrap, axios, Vue CLI. I chose to install the JSON server because it is able to mimic REST API to help with the front-end development process. Sometimes back-end server is not fully developed, and for a front-end developer, this could be a good tool to help focus on building the front end without the real data. 

▸At a first glance, I felt that this project could be divided into mainly 2 components: user, and gallery components. A user card is something that could be used over and over again on different pages so it would be nice to carve that out along with other components such as header/footer.

▸From here on I focused on CSS using bootstrap and tweaking things so that it could be as close to the design presented. ( I used 1440px as my default size )

▸I wanted to delve more into Laravel so that I could set up a landscapes.json file but ran into some errors while migrating them. I would like to continue to try this out on my own!
